 FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **买入**

这是我的建议，基于市场数据和分析情况，我们建议购买603127.SH。

理由是，这家公司 caught the eye of the long crowd due to its strong intellectual property barriers, leading research investments, and favorable industry trends. In the context of China's innovative drug policy support and the aging population's increasing demand, the long-term logic appears solid.

While the short-term worries expressed by the bearish analysts are reasonable, they do not undermine the company's current patent barriers, and financial and research data have not shown signs of deterioration in the short term.

### Strategies:
1. **Portfolio Allocation**: Phase in the positions, starting with a 50% investment of the planned capital, with the remaining 50% being invested upon a 5% call or new-drug approval milestone.
2. **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**: Establish a target price based on a 2025 PE ratio of 30x (corresponding to a net profit of 36 billion yuan), with a stop-loss set at a dip below the annual low (technical support level).
3. **Tracking Metrics**: Quarterly R&D expense rate (warning line at 20%) and Cleviprex market share (if below 60%, re-evaluate the position).

### Past Errors Reflection:
In the past, we may have underestimated the risk of policy changes in the pharmaceutical industry (such as mandatory purchases), but Shao Yong Pharmaceuticals, as an innovative drug-focused company, is less impacted by policy changes. This decision emphasizes the company's technology barriers rather than short-term policy games.

("Conversationally")
To summarize, Shao Yong Pharmaceuticals has enough ammunition (patents + pipeline) to fight a long war, and short-term volatility could even present opportunities to jump on board. However, keep a close eye on R&D spending - don't let it transform from "innovative pioneer" into a "cash flow black hole."
